## UI Improvement
We have implemented a new login page. This new page looks far cleaner than the one that we had previously thrown together. Additionally, on the mood page, the UI for main graph has been updated to look better as well, and is semi interactive. This is also true for the data visuialization modals, as they now show information in bar graphs instead of raw probability scores. 

## Data Visualization 
We have added a data visualization along with the lyrics when clicking a song in the mood page. We feel that that this can easily show users the mood of the songs. Before we only had a text displaying percentages, now we show in a horizontal bar graph, in which users can clearly see which mood/sentiment is the dominant sentiment of the song. Based on this, the users have an idea of which songs fit which mood they are feeling or may want to feel best.
