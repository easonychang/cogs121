## UI Improvement
We have implemented a new login page. 

## Data Visualization 
We have added a data visualization along with the lyrics when clicking a song in the mood page. We feel that that this can easily show users the mood of the songs. Before we only had a text displaying percentages, now we show in a horizontal bar graph, in which users can clearly see which mood/sentiment is the dominant sentiment of the song.
