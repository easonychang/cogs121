Project Idea
====

Spotify Mood:

Base on the user’s playlist history, either base on day, or the previous tracks, determine the user’s mood, and recommend songs based on mood.

Photo Rater:
	Rates photos based on rule of thirds, lighting, etc. Helps amateurs filter photos well/learn how to take pictures better.

Deja Vu: 
	Once a week, the user is prompted to take a picture of wherever they are and they will be alerted when they are at the same spot again and they can see the picture they took there last time.

Glass Jar:
	Budgeting app. You set a budget for yourself each week and put record whatever you used money on. Money decreases from “glass jar” (gui) every time you spend it. 

Win Win: 
	Motivation app where you set goals for yourself and if they aren’t fulfilled, you make a monetary donation to charity.
