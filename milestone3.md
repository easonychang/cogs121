## Home Page

I made few changes to the home page, mostly sticking to the paper prototype that I developed. One of the changes that I did make, however, was getting rid of the hamburger menu in the top navigation bar. I did this because I felt as if it was redundant when every part of the app can be accessed via other visible icons. I am also considering getting rid of the top navbar entirely and moving the settings icon to the bottom nav bar.
