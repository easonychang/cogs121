## Home Page

I made few changes to the home page, mostly sticking to the paper prototype that I developed. One of the changes that I did make, however, was getting rid of the hamburger menu in the top navigation bar. I did this because I felt as if it was redundant when every part of the app can be accessed via other visible icons. I am also considering getting rid of the top navbar entirely and moving the settings icon to the bottom nav bar. 

## Mood Page

For the mood page, however, I decided that it may be best to focus solely on the mood statistics instead of the number of songs listened to. In future iterations, this may change to reflect the paper prototype which includes number of songs listened to, or something else involving the songs in greater detail. 


## Playlist

This is the playlist page. It will contain a generated playlist of songs to fit the chosen mood. Soon there will be buttons to allow users to save the playlist to Spotify, edit the playlist, and generate a new playlist.
