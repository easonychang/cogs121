Although the overall UI has not changed too much, we have added a modal that displays the lyrics when clicking a song in the mood page. We feel that this applies to an improvement of the UI because the user is literally able to interact further with the interface, and access more information. They are able to see the exact mood statistics for each song that they have listened to. 


## Actions 

One non trivial action that we have added is the ability to click on a song which leads to a pop-up on the screen that shows the mood statistics, as well as displaying the lyrics of the song that they have clicked. 

Another non trivial action is that we have the ability to get the user's most recently played songs as well as the ability to get top songs.
