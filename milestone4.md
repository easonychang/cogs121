## Home Page UI Improvement

This screenshot shows two things. I have taken out the settings cog from the top navbar, leaving only the brand name of our product for a cleaner feeling and moved it to the bottom. The navbar is now bootstrap for a cleaner look as well. I have also changed the divs holding the songs to be columns so that there are two displayed side by side. This compensates for some of the white space, especially in desktop view, and more information can be presented at once. In future iterations I will continue to improve on this. 

## Playlist Page UI Improvement

The playlist page UI has been completely changed. Previously, songs were listed out one by one. Now they are contained to their own categories which in future milestones will lead to a separate page with songs curated for the user. This avoids overwhelming the user with information, and the user will be able to clearly pick a playlist for their particular mood, unlike the previous iteration which would just have a list of songs. 


## Privacy
In order to address user privacy we have and are designing our project in a way that does not use needless personal data, and requires user consent. We have implemented a log in screen so data can only be accessed if the user permits it, and we are also only using the necessary data, ie recent songs listened to, to run our program. We are not currently looking into where the user is located or other personal information that is not pertinent to the project. The log in screen also ensures that any data being used is with the consent of the user. We have also considered adding a disclaimer or a small terms and conditions notice at log in so that the user is fully aware of what data we are extracting via Spotify.
